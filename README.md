project Report
Project Description:

The banking industry world-wide is being transformed. The global forces for change include technological innovation; the deregulation of financial services at the national level and opening-up to international competition; and - equally important - changes in corporate behavior, such as growing disintermediation and increased emphasis on shareholder value. In addition, recent banking crises in Asia and Latin America have accentuated these pressures. The banking industries in central Europe and Latin America have also been transformed as a result of privatizations of state-owned banks that had dominated their banking systems in the past. In this project we are trying to analysis the bank related data and able to extract some insights from the data using Business Intelligence tools. To Extract the Insights from the data and put the data in the form of visualizations, Dashboards and Story we employed Tableau tool.
